# Elus

This is my implementation of *ELUS*, a neat logic puzzle game I stumbled upon in the **Space Rangers 2: Rise of the Dominators** video game.

At first glance, ELUS looks like a simple pattern recognition game... but it has a twist: you need to figure out the pattern while you are playing the game!

**Disclaimer: I did not come up with the idea of this game, I only reproduced the logic in JavaScript to practice my programming skills.**
